# Capstone: Rust Performance Observatory
*Build, deploy, and measure a complete streaming data pipeline*

---

## Mission Statement

Your mission is to create a local performance laboratory where you can deploy Rust services, generate realistic workloads, and extract meaningful performance insights. This synthesizes everything you've learned into answering: **"How performant is my Rust code, really?"**

**End Goal**: A functioning streaming pipeline deployed to local k3s with comprehensive performance tooling that you built and understand.

## Architecture Challenge

Design and implement this system:

```
Data Generator → Processing Pipeline → Results Storage
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓
Performance Monitoring & Analysis Dashboard
```

**Your Design Decisions**:
- What data format will you stream? (JSON, binary, protobuf?)
- How will you generate realistic load patterns?
- What processing will stress-test your Rust code?
- How will you measure and store performance data?

## Phase 1: Kubernetes Lab Setup

### Challenge: Build Your Performance Lab
**Problem**: You need a local environment that mimics production for realistic performance testing.

**Requirements**:
- Local k3s cluster 
- Fast container iteration (local registry?)
- Performance monitoring capability
- Database for storing results

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Research**: What k3s configuration optimizes for performance testing?
2. **Implement**: Set up k3s with the components you need
3. **Validate**: Deploy a simple "hello world" service and measure its baseline performance

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you disable k3s components you don't need?
- What's the fastest way to iterate on container builds?
- How do you set up Prometheus/monitoring in k3s?

### Challenge: Container Build Strategy
**Problem**: Rust binaries are large and builds are slow. You need fast iteration.

**Your Tasks**:
1. Create a multi-stage Dockerfile that optimizes for both build speed and runtime size
2. Set up a local registry for fast pushes
3. Implement a build script that minimizes iteration time

**Questions to Solve**:
- What Docker layers can you cache to speed up Rust builds?
- How do you optimize container size without sacrificing debug info?
- What's the fastest way to get code changes into k3s?

## Phase 2: Data Streaming Pipeline

### Challenge: Realistic Data Generation
**Problem**: You need streaming data that stresses your Rust code in meaningful ways.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Design**: What kind of data will reveal performance bottlenecks?
2. **Implement**: Build a data generator that produces realistic load patterns
3. **Scale**: Make it configurable to test different throughput levels

**Ideas to Research**:
- Market data with timestamps and price changes
- IoT sensor readings with periodic bursts
- Log events with different message sizes and frequencies

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you generate data with realistic patterns (bursts, quiet periods)?
- What data formats stress different parts of your processing pipeline?
- How do you ensure your generator doesn't become the bottleneck?

### Challenge: Zero-Copy Processing Pipeline
**Problem**: Build a Rust service that processes streaming data efficiently.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Design**: What processing will showcase Rust's performance advantages?
2. **Implement**: Use zero-copy techniques where possible
3. **Measure**: Identify where allocations occur and why

**Processing Ideas**:
- JSON parsing with `#[serde(borrow)]`
- Data aggregation over sliding time windows
- Complex filtering and transformation logic

**Questions to Solve**:
- Where can you use borrowing instead of owned data?
- How do you handle backpressure when processing can't keep up?
- What error handling strategy works best for streaming data?

## Phase 3: Performance Measurement Infrastructure

### Challenge: Multi-Dimensional Performance Monitoring
**Problem**: You need to measure CPU, memory, latency, and throughput simultaneously.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Instrument**: Add performance counters to your Rust services
2. **Collect**: Gather metrics from multiple services
3. **Store**: Design a schema for performance data over time

**Metrics to Capture**:
- Request latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory allocation patterns
- CPU usage and wait times
- Throughput and error rates

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you measure Rust performance without affecting performance?
- What's the best way to export metrics from Kubernetes pods?
- How do you correlate metrics across different services?

### Challenge: Automated Performance Profiling
**Problem**: You need systematic profiling data, not just high-level metrics.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Automate**: Generate flame graphs on demand
2. **Compare**: Build tooling to compare performance across versions
3. **Alert**: Detect when performance regresses

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you get flame graphs from containerized Rust applications?
- What's the best way to trigger profiling runs?
- How do you store and compare profile data over time?

## Phase 4: Kubernetes-Native Orchestration

### Challenge: Custom Resource Definition (CRD)
**Problem**: Kubernetes needs to understand your performance pipeline as a first-class resource.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Design**: Define a CRD for your streaming pipeline
2. **Implement**: Write a controller that manages pipeline lifecycle
3. **Test**: Deploy pipelines through Kubernetes manifests

**CRD Design Questions**:
- What parameters should be configurable (data rate, processing logic, resource limits)?
- How do you represent the relationship between generator, processor, and storage?
- What status fields help with debugging and monitoring?

### Challenge: Rust Operator Implementation
**Problem**: Build a Rust operator that manages your performance pipelines.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Research**: Learn the Kubernetes controller pattern
2. **Implement**: Use `kube-rs` to build your operator
3. **Deploy**: Run your operator in the cluster

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you watch for CRD changes and react appropriately?
- What's the reconciliation logic for your pipeline resources?
- How do you handle errors and retries in your operator?

## Phase 5: Performance Analysis & Optimization

### Challenge: Comparative Performance Testing
**Problem**: You need systematic ways to test if changes improve performance.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Framework**: Build tooling to run A/B performance tests
2. **Automate**: Create CI-like workflows for performance testing
3. **Analyze**: Develop methods to detect meaningful performance differences

**Questions to Solve**:
- How do you ensure fair comparisons between different versions?
- What statistical methods help distinguish real improvements from noise?
- How do you test performance under different load patterns?

### Challenge: Optimization Discovery
**Problem**: Find and fix performance bottlenecks systematically.

**Your Tasks**:
1. **Identify**: Use your monitoring to find the worst bottlenecks
2. **Hypothesis**: Form theories about what's causing the problems
3. **Test**: Implement fixes and measure the impact
4. **Document**: Record what optimizations worked and why

**Optimization Areas to Explore**:
- Memory allocation patterns and arena allocators
- CPU-bound operations and vectorization
- I/O efficiency and async coordination
- Data structure layout and cache locality

## Mastery Validation

Your capstone is complete when you can:

**Deploy and Measure**:
- Deploy your pipeline to k3s with a single command
- Generate realistic load and measure all performance dimensions
- Compare performance across different configurations

**Optimize and Validate**:
- Identify your system's bottlenecks using your own tooling
- Implement optimizations and measure their impact
- Prove that your optimizations provide real benefits

**Operate and Debug**:

## Research Guidelines

**For each phase, research these areas**:
- Read documentation for the tools you're using
- Look at real-world examples and production deployments  
- Understand the trade-offs in your design decisions
- Test your assumptions with measurements

**Key learning outcome**: You should understand every component you deploy and be able to explain how it contributes to your system's performance characteristics.

**This capstone tests everything**: spatial lifetime understanding, async coordination, error handling, performance measurement, and systems thinking. The goal is not just a working system, but a deep understanding of how Rust performs in production-like scenarios.
